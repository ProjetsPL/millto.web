## Laying tiles - not as difficult as you think

Laying tiles - both on the floor and on the wall is not that difficult to do. **A proper preparation is key**. It concerns both the surface which is going to be tiled, as well as the equipment to help you with the task. If you're wondering how to lay tiles - this guide is perfect for you. In **3 easy steps** you can learn about the most important stages which will prepare you for laying tiles.

## Before you start tiling the floor or walls - prepare the surface

**The grip to the base**, as well as the durability of the tiles depend on the proper preparation of the surface one is going to work on. It concerns both floors and walls.

Most importantly, **the base for tiles** should be **even.** Preparation of the surface in this regard is typically conducted at the earlier stages of finishing an interior - especially in new buildings. If the room is being renovated, the surface might require smoothening - some bumps and dents might have been formed with removal of the floor or wall covering.

What to do in such a case? Leveling the surface before tiling is not a complicated issue and you can easily do it e.g. using a **self-leveling compound** designed for this purpose. After mixing the mass by following the manufacturer's instructions, it should be poured onto areas which need leveling. You can use a special rubber trowel to reach the corners of the room.

When leveling **the walls,** keep in mind that the compound mass should be thicker so that it doesn't slide off the surface it has been placed on.

### Priming before leveling

In most cases the surface **does not need to be primed before using a compound** to increase its adhesiveness. However, if you have a particularly absorbent ground, it is recommended. How to check it? You need a sponge. Soak it and press onto the surface you are going to tile. If the water gets absorbed pretty quickly - consider priming the surface.
