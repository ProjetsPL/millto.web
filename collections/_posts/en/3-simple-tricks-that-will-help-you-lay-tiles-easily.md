After mixing the mass by following the manufacturer's instructions, it should be poured onto areas which need leveling. You can use a special rubber trowel to reach the corners of the room.

When leveling **the walls,** keep in mind that the compound mass should be thicker so that it doesn't slide off the surface it has been placed on.

### Priming before leveling

In most cases the surface **does not need to be primed before using a compound** to increase its adhesiveness. However, if you have a particularly absorbent ground, it is recommended. How to check it? You need a sponge. Soak it and press onto the surface you are going to tile. If the water gets absorbed pretty quickly - consider priming the surface.

### Removing dirt

If the surface you are going to **tile** is full of the previous layer residues or various kinds of dirt - make sure to remove them. The same applies to **greasy stains and residues from unknown liquids.**
