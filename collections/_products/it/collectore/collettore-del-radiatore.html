  ## How often is a radiant heat manifold used?

  A radiant heat manifold is one of the most basic elements in a heating system of every building. It can be used both in a house and in an apartment. Its role is spreading the heat evenly, so the conduits of the heating system work efficiently and provide the proper thermal comfort.

  ### Heat manifold - where can it be used?

  A radiant heat manifold is a very universal solution, which can be used both in traditional systems - those using classic radiators, and in modern underfloor heating systems. For each of those systems, a manifold allows for easy temperature control, depending on the needs of its users.

  ## Radiant heat manifolds - construction

  The construction of a radiant heat manifold is very similar to other models of equipment of this type. The difference lies in small, yet important details, which makes this manifold unique. Complete sets offered by manufacturers contain all needed elements, allowing the users to assemble and run the device.

  The set contains installation holders and bars, which are the basis of the whole device. The bars have been equipped with nipples to install circuits and red and blue control valves.

  ### Holders and bars - the base of every manifold

  Regardless of the manufacturer, all holders sold with manifolds are made of stainless steel. It prevents vibrations which could disrupt the device's operation, and, as a result affect its efficiency. Thanks to those elements there's no concern about the fixing of the equipment. It's reliable - and durable for a very long time.

  Another, probably the most important elements are bars. They contain brass nipples that should be attached to specific circuits. The upper bar also has control valves attached, which regulate the flow of the warm liquid. The lower bar contains valves that control the cold water. They can be easily distinguished by their colour.

  ### Brass nipples - how to quickly attach a radiant heat manifold?

  There are brass nipples on the manifold bars. They serve the most important role for the whole device. Without them, the heat manifold would be useless. Nipples allow for attaching heating circuits to the device - thanks to which a manifold can easily control the temperature in each of them.

  ### Control valves - how to easily set up a manifold?

  Control valves allow for a quick regulation of the manifold device. Manual control is very easy, therefore, most of the users should be able to do it. Each valve has a 5-grade scale on it. Thanks to this, one can control the manifold at any time. Increasing or decreasing the warmth level in a room will never be a problem anymore. Just turn the valve that controls a particular circuit.

  ## How to choose the right radiant heat manifold?

  When choosing a manifold, you should pay attention to the number of circuits in your heating system. There are manifold models that allow to control from 2 to 12 circuits. For this reason, one should match the device with individual needs of a user.

  If you are unsure how many circuits your manifold should have - consult this issue with an expert responsible for the heating system of the building. Too many, as well as too little of circuits of a radiant heat manifold can complicate the whole system's operation, makes it prone to malfunctions and inefficient.

  ### How much does a radiant heat manifold cost?

  The price of equipment like a manifold depends on the number of circuits that can be attached to it. The cheapest manifolds are the models that can operate 2 circuits. The cost of the device rises with every additional circuit. It also results from the construction of a manifold, which requires using a larger number of equipment.

<h2>Is warmth your priority? We'll provide you comfort!</h2>
<p>Do you like surprises? Can you imagine a situation in which you get the warmth at will? It's not a futuristic scenario, but real possibilities. You can achieve them if you choose the functional radiant heat manifold. It's easier than you think.</p>
<h2>Household heating revolution - the universal manifold</h2>
<p>The radiant heat manifold is a product of a wide variety of applications. You can use it in central heating systems, as well as in underfloor heating. What distinguishes is from other products? You can use it to easily control the temperature of a room. The device can be adjusted to your individual needs.</p>
<p>Are you cold? Just turn the valve to change the parameters and rediscover the magic of coziness and warmth. Sounds great, right? What's more, it's very easy!</p>
<h2>We choose the highest quality and durability! How about you?</h2>
<p>When designing the underfloor heating manifold, we focused mostly on precision and durability, which guarantee efficiency for a long time. That's why the both the construction of the product and all its assets has been made of the best available materials. We are not interested in half measures - we give you a product that we would like to use.</p>
<h3>We value your time</h3>
<p>The nipples allow for connecting the manifold with specific circuits of the device. Thanks to them, you can do it in the blink of an eye - even if you don't have any experience in that matter.</p>
<h3>Unproblematic installation? We thought about it!</h3>
<p>Are you afraid you will not be able to install the manifold correctly and something will disrupt the whole system? The holders that support the whole device have been made of a strong material. There is no chance that something goes wrong during the installation. Just attach the holders to a surface - they will prevent the device from any movement.</p>
<h3>The perfect temperature - feel the highest level of satisfaction</h3>
<p>To make it easy, the control valves of the manifold have been marked with two colours - red and blue. Each of them has a 5-grade scale. Thanks to this, you can individually adjust the temperature to your own expectations. It's very easy thanks to the clear symbols - you will not have any problems with control. You can enjoy the highest level of thermal comfort - always.</p>
<h2>Learn your possibilities</h2>
<p>The brass radiant heat manifold is available in various versions - from 2 to 12 circuits. It gives you plenty of possibilities to match the equipment with your individual expectations. Choose a model that suits the needs of your heating system and enjoy its efficiency for a long time.</p>
