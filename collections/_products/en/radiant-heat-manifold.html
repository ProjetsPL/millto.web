<h2>Modern equipment - manifold for central and underfloor heating</h2>
<p>Thermal comfort is one of the key aspects of functioning of every building. It mostly depends on using new technologies, as well as proper installation. Easy maintenance of the devices used in various rooms is also a highly important matter for most of the users. A radiant heat manifold is an element used nowadays both in industrial and residential buildings. It can be applied to traditional radiator central heating as well as to underfloor heating systems.</p>
<h2>Underfloor heating system - a manifold instead of radiators</h2>
<p>Underfloor heating system is a good alternative for traditional heating solutions that have been used for years. Contrary to the classic systems, this one does not involve the installation of radiatots on the walls. Instead, a special system is installed under the floor, which provides a proper thermal comfort - either in the whole building or in designated zones.</p>
<p>The most important issue in this case is planning the whole work - especially aspects such as arrangement of each element of the system. A radiant heat manifold is one of them. If it's possible, it's best to create a project at the stage of the building's construction. This is also the moment when one should decide the method of powering the system. One can choose either water of electric underfloor heating system.</p>
<p>The first of those options is definitely more popular, as it is more economical. The principle of operation here is  quite simple. The cords that are inside the water underfloor heating system are heated up to lower temperatures in comparison to the traditional radiators. Despite this fact, the warmth level is the same in both cases. It means that in a room where a PEX manifold has been used, the temperature is exactly the same as in the one with radiators - but the energy consumption is much lower.</p>
<h2>Why should you choose underfloor heating?</h2>
<p>An increasing number of people notice the advantages of underfloor heating systems. First of all, it's a system that reponds perfectly to biological needs of a human being. Because the heat first gets to the lower parts and travels upwards in a regular manner (it's controlled by a manifold) - it provides a proper thermal comfort to a human body.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an underfloor heating system is highly recommended to anyone who suffers from an allergy. By eliminating radiators, one can reduce the dust accumulation in a room. It also removes the problem of air movement, therefore allergens are not pulled upwards, so they don't enter one's respiratory system.</p>
<p>However, the proper functioning of such a system highly depends on its proper construction and use of elements such as a manifold. Picking the right type of equipment guarantees no need of its maintenace, as well as durability of the instalation for a long time - regardless where it has been placed.</p>
<h3>A manifold - the basic element of an underfloor heating system</h3>
<p>A manifold is a necessary invention that greatly influenced the quality of undefloor heating systems. First and foremost, it improves the efficiency of heating. A manifold also prevents the floor from overheating at particular spots. The heat spreads evenly across the whole surface where the system has been installed. Therefore, one could say that a manifold helps to balance the whole installation. Thanks to this, the system is efficient and works properly.</p>
<p>There are many type of such equipment available on the market. Each manifold for underfloor heating can differ by material, accessories and number of sections. One should consider all of those elements when designing a heating system.</p>
<h2>Radiant heat manifold for underfloor heating - how does it work?</h2>
<p>Water underfloor heating systems are exceptional, as they use a lot of layered pipes, which form loops. Each of them is supposed to supply heat to a particular area. What's important, the loops are not even. It means that they caan have different lengths. It's directly connected with water flow on a given area. A properly working system depends on using equipment such as radiant heat manifold with control valves. They allow for control over the flow of the liquid through the system.</p>
<h2>Radiant heat manifold for a radiator - what is it?</h2>
<p>Apart form underfloor heating, radiators are still commonly used in some cases. Those two solutions can be used simultaneously in one building. One can connect a radiator with a manifold - so that one has control over all radiators in the building. In case one of them malfunctions and needs repair - manifold allows for cutting the supply just in one of the circuits. The rest of the heating systems will work as usual.</p>
