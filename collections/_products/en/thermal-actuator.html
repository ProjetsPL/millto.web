seo_content: "## What is a thermal actuator?\n\nAn electric thermal actuator is one
  of the basic elements used for heating devices. It controls their functioning. It's
  a very practical solution - an actuator can quickly affect certain elements of the
  heating system.  \n  \nA thermal actuator is typically used when there is a need
  to control the temperature in a room automatically. It is worth noting there is
  a wide variety of thermal actuators on the market. For this reason, it is not difficult
  to find the right model for a system of traditional heaters or for floor heating.
  A thermal actuator is used definitely more often for floor heating systems.\n\n##
  A thermal actuator - how does it work?\n\nThe functioning of a thermal actuator
  is not a complicated process. It mostly depends on a thermostat, which reads the
  heat level in a room. If the temperature changes, the actuator receives a signal
  which prompts it to control the valves on the distributor.  \n  \nIf the temperature
  in a room rises above the level set in the thermostat - a signal is sent to activate
  the actuator and close the valve. In case of a temperature drop - the thermal actuator
  opens the valve.\n\n## The thermal actuator - structure\n\nThe most important part
  of the thermal actuator is its body, which contains the whole mechanism. This is
  where the power cord sticks out from. If needed, it can be extended - in compliance
  with the rules of electricity. It must be properly insulated.  \n  \nThe body of
  an actuator is usually made of a plastic material. Polypropylene is perfect for
  this purpose, because of its durability properties.  \n  \nThe outside of the element
  contains either a gauge or a handle which allows to control valve opening or closing.\n\n##
  Thermal actuator - how to choose the right type?\n\nBecause manufacturers offer
  a wide range of various equipment, one can easily find an electric thermal actuator
  to fit their individual needs and their heating system. Before deciding on a particular
  solution, one should consider several important aspects, which will allow to learn
  the class of a particular device.  \n  \nThe type of construction is a highly important
  matter. Most of the thermal actuators available on the market fit standard M30x1.5mm
  valves - but one should pay special attention to this feature. It might happen that
  one model is different in this regard.  \n  \nAnother important aspect is voltage.
  Usually it's a universal parameter, therefore, a 230V thermal actuator is a popular
  product.  \n  \nSpeed rate - it's something characteristic for modern devices. An
  estimated reaction time of a thermal actuator is at most 5 minutes. The shorter
  the time of waiting - the better.  \n  \nIs power consumption of a thermal actuator
  an important feature? It might seem that the answer is no. However, the lower power
  consumption - the lower the maintenance costs. Energy use shouldn't be higher than
  5W - the best rate is 2-3W.\n\n## Why should you buy an electric thermal actuator?\n\nA
  thermal actuator can help increase the functionality of the central heating in a
  building. It's a solution which has a direct impact on the convenience of the system.
  How is it possible? A thermal actuator doesn't require any sort of control from
  the user. It's a perfect way to keep the ideal temperature level in a room, which
  also contributes to heating savings.\n\n## How to install a thermal actuator?\n\nBecause
  a thermal actuator is so easy to install, it's something anyone can do. There is
  plenty of graphic guides and videos on how to do it in the web. What's more, manufacturers
  often add their own instructions to the product.\n\n## How much does a thermal actuator
  cost?\n\nThe purchase of an electric thermal actuator is not a big expense, especially
  when one considers the advantages of such a solution. The simplest models available
  on the market are quite cheap. The more advanced and complicated the device - the
  higher the price."
