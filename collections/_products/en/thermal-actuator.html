  ## Where a thermal actuator is typically used?

  An electric thermal actuator is one of the basic elements used for heating devices. It controls the way they work. It's a very practical solution - an actuator can quickly affect certain elements of the heating system.

  A thermal actuator is typically used wherever an automatic temperature control in a room is planned. It is worth noting that there is a wide variety of thermal actuators on the market. Hence, finding the right type both for a system of traditional heaters as well as for floor heating is not a problem. A thermal actuator is used definitely more often for floor heating systems.

  ## A thermal actuator - how does it work?

  Functioning of a thermal actuator is not a complicated process. It mostly depends on the use of a thermostat, which is responsible for reading the heat level in a room. If the temperature changes, the actuator receives a signal which prompts it to control the valves on the distributor.

  If the temperature in a room rises above the level set in the thermostat - a signal is sent to activate the actuator and close the valve. In case of a tempereature drop - the thermal actuator opens the valve.

  ## The thermal actuator - structure

  The main part of the thermal actuator product is its body, which contains the whole mechanism. This is where the power cord sticks out from. If needed, it can be extended,  in compliance with electricity procedures. In such a case, it should be insulated.

  The body of an actuator is usually made of a plastic material. In this case polypropylene is perfect for its durability properties.

  The outside of the element contains either a gauge or a handle which allows to control opening or closing a valve.

  ## Thermal actuators types - how to choose the right one?

  Because manufacturers offer various type of equipment, everyone can pick an electric thermal actuator which fits their individual needs and their heating system. Before choosing a particular solution, one should pay attention to several important aspects, which will allow to classify the devices.

  The construction is highly important. Most of the thermal actuators available on the market fit standard M30x1.5mm valves - although one should pay special attention to this feature. It might happen that one model is different in this regards.

  Another important aspect is voltage. It's also a universal parameter. Therefore, a 230V thermal actuator is a popular product.

  Speed rate - it's something characteristic for modern devices. An estimated time of reaction of a thermal actuator is maximally 5 minutes. The shorter the time of waiting - the better.

  Is power consumption of a thermal actuator an important feature? It might seem that the answer is no. However, the lower power consumption - the lower maintenace costs. Energy use shouldn't be higher than 5W - the best rate is 2-3W.

  ## Why should you buy an electric thermal actuator?

  A thermal actuator can help to increase the functionality of the central heating in a building. It's a solution which directly affects the convenience of the system. How is it possible? A thermal actuator doesn't require control from the user. It's a perfect way to keep the perfect temperature level in a room, which also contributes to savings on heating.

  ## How to install a thermal actuator?

  Because a thermal actuator is so easy to install, it's something anyone can do. There is a lot of graphic guides and videos on how to do it in the web. What's more, manufacturers often add their own instructions to the product.

  ## How much does a thermal actuator cost?

  A purchase of an electric thermal actuator is not a big expense, especially when one considers the advantages of such a solution. The simplest models available on the market are quite cheap. The more advanced and complicated the device - the higher the price.
