  ## Where a thermal actuator is typically used?

  An electric thermal actuator is one of the basic elements used for heating devices. It controls the way they work. It's a very practical solution - an actuator can quickly affect certain elements of the heating system.

  A thermal actuator is typically used wherever an automatic temperature control in a room is planned. It is worth noting that there is a wide variety of thermal actuators on the market. Hence, finding the right type both for a system of traditional heaters as well as for floor heating is not a problem. A thermal actuator is used definitely more often for floor heating systems.

  ## A thermal actuator - how does it work?

  Functioning of a thermal actuator is not a complicated process. It mostly depends on the use of a thermostat, which is responsible for reading the heat level in a room. If the temperature changes, the actuator receives a signal which prompts it to control the valves on the distributor.

  If the temperature in a room rises above the level set in the thermostat - a signal is sent to activate the actuator and close the valve. In case of a tempereature drop - the thermal actuator opens the valve.
