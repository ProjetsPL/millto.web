  ## What is a manhole?

  A manhole is one of the most basic elements used in modern sewer systems. Sometimes it is called an inspection chamber or an access chamber. Depending on the type, manholes can be used in various areas. In each case they are the key elements of the whole system.

  ## What is the purpose of an inspection chamber?

  As the name indicates, an inspection chamber is used for inspection - it's simply a hole that allows for the sewer system control. An easy access to sewer pipes enables their easier cleaning, and in case of a malfunction one can react swiftly and eliminate the problem without the need to shut the whole system down.

  ## Manhole types available on the market

  Manholes are distinguished mostly by the type of material they are made of. With regards to this factor, one can separate three primary groups, known as a classification by weight. Based upon this, manholes can be:

  * heavy - produced mostly from concrete mixtures,
  * medium - made of cement and composite materials or ductile cast iron,
  * light - made from thermoplastic resin, mostly polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP).

  There are also tin-plate inspection chambers, although they are hardly manufactured anymore. In this case the material is classified as "light."

  Furthermore, there are also manholes with body made from one material and the cover from another.

  ## A manhole - what is it made from?

  A manhole is a product that consists of two elements. The structure is very simple. The main part (body) looks like a short pipe. Its shape can be compared to a cup. The second component is a cover. It conceals the chamber and protects it from contamination.

  The high quality of the materials used for a manhole construction directly impacts its durability. The elements are resistant to mechanical damage and other harmful factors. The inspection chamber can be installed also in spots of higher risk from negative weather conditions like rain, snow, low and high temperatures and exposure to sun.

  Every sewer manhole is resistant to physical damage. They aren't prone to cracks or deformation - provided that they are used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

  ## Does the diameter of a manhole matter?

  Manufacturers provide various manholes with different diameters. The choice of a particular size depends on many factors - mostly on the location and the construction of the whole sewer system.

  If you have no experience in this field, you can ask a professional for advice before making a decision.

  ## How a manhole is installed?

  Before installing an inspection chamber, take a look at several important aspects. One of the most crucial issues is the choice of location. As most sewer specialists claim, an easy access is a major factor. A manhole cannot be located in a dip or a high traffic spot. Furthermore, one should specially analyze the terrain in terms of water accumulation.

  During the process of installation, you should respect all the rules and suggestions included in the manufacturer's instruction.

  ## Are manholes expensive?

  The cost of a manhole depends mostly on factors like material and size. Models made of plastic materials - the aforementioned polypropylene or polyethylene are definitely the cheapest ones. A cast iron and concrete inspection chamber is a more expensive investment - but it also depends on the size. Keep in mind that a higher price very often means a better quality of a product. In other words, this type of a manhole will serve much longer than its cheaper counterparts.

  ## How to conceal a manhole in the garden?

  An outside manhole is the basic element on properties with gravity sewerage. An inspection chamber is also a component of rain and water systems. Although usually it is quite small, many homeowners wonder how to conceal a manhole in the garden. The easiest way involves putting a decorative element on it. It can be a flower pot or a garden figurine. If needed, such an element can be quickly removed so that the manhole is ready to use.
