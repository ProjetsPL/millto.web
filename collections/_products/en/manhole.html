  ## What is a manhole?

  A manhole is one of the most basic elements used in modern sewer systems. Sometimes it is called an inspection chamber or a access chaamber. Depending on the type, manholes can be used in various areas. In each case they are the key elements of the whole system.

  ## What is the purpose of an inspection chamber?

  As the name indicates, an inspection chambeer is used for inspection - it's a hole that allows for the sewer system control. An easy access to sewer pipes enables their easier cleaning, and in case of a malfunction one can react swiftly and eliminate the problem without the need to turn the whole system off.

  ## Manhole types available on the market

  Manholes are distinguished mostly by the type of material they are made of. With regards to this factor, one can separate three primary groups, which are sometimes called a classification by weight. Based upon this, manholes can be:

  * heavy - produced mostly from concrete mixtures,
  * medium - made of cement and composite materials or ductile cast iron,
  * light - made from thermoplastic resin, mostly polyethylene (PE) and poolypropylene (PP).

  There are also inscpection chambers made from tin-plate, although they are hardly manufacanhole - what is it made from?

  A manhole is a product that consists of two elements. The structure is very simple. The main part (body) looks loke a short pipe and it can be compared to a cup. The second component is a cover. It conceals the chamber and protects it from contamination.

  The high quality of the materials used for a manhole construction directly impacts its durability. The elements are resistant to mechanical damage and other harmful factors. The inspection chamber can be installed also in spots of higher risk from negative weather conditions like rain, snow, low and high temperatures and exposure to sun.

  Every sewer manhole is resistant to physical damage. They aren't prone to cracks or deformation - provided that they are used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

  ## Does the diameter of a manhole matter?

  Manufacturers provide variouss manholes with different diameters. The choice of a particular size depends on many factors - mostly on the location and the construuction of the whole sewer system.tured anymore. In this case the material is classified as "light".

  Furthermore, there are also manholes whose body has been made from one material, and the cover from another.
