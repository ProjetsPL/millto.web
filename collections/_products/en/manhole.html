seo_content: "## What is a manhole?\n\nA manhole is one of the most basic elements
  used in modern sewer systems. Sometimes it is called an inspection chamber or a
  access chaamber. Depending on the type, manholes can be used in various areas. In
  each case they are the key elements of the whole system.\n\n## What is the purpose
  of an inspection chamber?\n\nAs the name indicates, an inspection chambeer is used
  for inspection - it's a hole that allows for the sewer system control. An easy access
  to sewer pipes enables their easier cleaning, and in case of a malfunction one can
  react swiftly and eliminate the problem without the need to turn the whole system
  off.\n\n## Manhole types available on the market\n\nManholes are distinguished mostly
  by the type of material they are made of. With regards to this factor, one can separate
  three primary groups, which are sometimes called a classification by weight. Based
  upon this, manholes can be:\n\n* heavy - produced mostly from concrete mixtures,\n*
  medium - made of cement and composite materials or ductile cast iron,\n* light -
  made from thermoplastic resin, mostly polyethylene (PE) and poolypropylene (PP).\n\nThere
  are also inscpection chambers made from tin-plate, although they are hardly manufactured
  anymore. In this case the material is classified as \"light\".\n\nFurthermore, there
  are also manholes whose body has been made from one material, and the cover from
  another.\n\n## A manhole - what is it made from?\n\nA manhole is a product that
  consists of two elements. The structure is very simple. The main part (body) looks
  loke a short pipe and it can be compared to a cup. The second component is a cover.
  It conceals the chamber and protects it from contamination.\n\nThe high quality
  of the materials used for a manhole construction directly impacts its durability.
  The elements are resistant to mechanical damage and other harmful factors. The inspection
  chamber can be installed also in spots of higher risk from negative weather conditions
  like rain, snow, low and high temperatures and exposure to sun.\n\nEvery sewer manhole
  is resistant to physical damage. They aren't prone to cracks or deformation - provided
  that they are used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n## Does
  the diameter of a manhole matter?\n\nManufacturers provide variouss manholes with
  different diameters. The choice of a particular size depends on many factors - mostly
  on the location and the construuction of the whole sewer system.\n\nIf you have
  no experience in this field, you can ask a professional for advice before making
  a decision. \n\n## How a manhole is installed?\n\nBefore installing an inspection
  chamber, conssider several important aspects. One of the most crucial issue is the
  choice of location. As most sewer specialists claim, an easy access is a major factor.
  A manhole cannot be located in a dip or a spot of high traffic. Furthermore, one
  should specially analyze the terrain in terms of water accumulation.\n\nDuring the
  process of installation one should respect all rules and suggestioons included in
  the manufacturer's instruction.\n\n## Are manholes expensive?\n\nThe cost of a manhole
  depends mostly on factors like material and size. Models made of plastic materials
  - the aforementioned polypropylene or polyethylene are definitely the cheapest ones.
  Aan inspection chamber made of cast iron and concrete are a more expensive investment
  - it also depends on the size. keep in mind that a higher price very often means
  a better quality of a product. In other words, this type of a manhole will serve
  much longer than its cheaper counterparts.\n\n## How to hide a manhole in the garden?\n\nAn
  outside manhole is the basic element on properties with gravity sewerage. An inspection
  chamber is also a component of rain and water systems. Although usually it is quite
  small, many homeowners wonder how to hide a manhole in the garden."
