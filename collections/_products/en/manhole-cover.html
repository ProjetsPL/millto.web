title: Manhole Cover | Sewage Pipes Always Under Control
description: "Do you want to build a fully functional and secure sewer system? \U0001F6E0️
  Make sure to choose the right manhole cover. ➡️ Learn what it should look like."
intro: A manhole cover is one of the basic elements of a sewage system. It helps to
  prevent the sewer gases from spreading. The cover also functions as an access eye,
  securing the manhole outlet and stopping dirt from getting inside.

  ## Manhole covers - safe and secure

  A manhole cover is a durable element which can withstand long-term utilization - it is not only resistant to weather conditions but also much load. Because of the broad choice of various manholes, one can fit the right product precisely to the user's needs and the type of surface. They can be classified by their size.

  The manhole cover is an ending of an inspection chamber. It can be made of various materials - this aspect affects the duration of the product. Cast iron manhole covers are quite popular elements, although they are used mostly in public spaces where they are exposed to high loads e.g. from road traffic. Intense use in such spaces requires not only a tight, but also highly durable manhole cover. It's important for the safety of anyone who is around the area.

  A plastic material manhole cover is typically used for less frequented areas, and it has many advantages. First of all, it weights two times less. It's also a more economical choice - compared to cast iron elements, they are far less expensive. At the same time, they comply with all safety norms and they have all necessary certificates to use them.,

  Manholes and manhole covers are the basic elements which allow for sewage system control, cleaning and - if needed - ventilation. For everyday use, a manhole cover keeps unpleasant smells inside the sewers.

  ## Where can one use a manhole cover?

  Manholes are among the most important elements in every sewage system. They connect the pipes of the system with the surface outside buildings. This particular spot is another important element called a manhole cover, or a pipe lid. It's the ending of the system, which allows to get a flat surface.

  ## Manhole cover shape - is it important?

   Most of the manhole covers available on the market are circular. It is not a random shape - its use is supported by science.

  A round manhole cover is definitely easier to install on the opening. The circular shape eliminates the need to fit the sides. It will always fit, regardless of its position.

  One of the biggest advantages of a circular manhole cover is high resistance to compression. Pressure put to the lid affects the surface around it. It's a definitely better shape which absorbs more weight load, which prevents the ground around the element from subsiding.

  Circular shape of the manhole cover means less surface area than in rectangular or triangular models. Seemingly, it does not matter for the user, as the differences are small. However the mentioned surface area requires less material used for production, which directly affects the price of a manhole cover.

  Safety is another important matter. A circular manhole cover is typically placed on a special ring on an access eye. It provides stabilization. Even if the element moves for some reason, it cannot fall inside. In such a case the cover blocks itself, thanks to which nothing can fall into the sewer system.

  ## Manhole covers classes

  Every manhole cover from Millto is produced in compliance with norms - in this case it's  PN-EN 124:2000. It's also connected with the products classification by certain parameters. There are six classes which indicate the load capacity of a manhole lid and what surface it can be ussed for. They are: A15, B125, C250, D400, E600 and F900.

  * A15 - manhole covers of this class can be used at places designated for pedestrians and bikes.
  * B125 - in addition to the two mentioned cases, manhole covers from this category can be used on parking lots and areas designated passenger cars.
  * C250 - it's a special group of products that can be installed by curbs. The distance from the traffic and pedestrian areas is strictly specified.
  * D400 - such manhole covers can be used on a roadway for car and foot traffic. They can be also installed on roadsides and parking lots - regardless of the type of vehicles that use them.
  * E600 - it's a category of manholes designated for places where the pressure from vehicles is high. They are typically used on airport runways and ramps.
  * F900 - the most durable mahole covers, used mostly at airports with the largest aircrafts generating the highest pressure on a runway.

  ## Manhole cover types

  There are many various models on the market, designated for different types of sewer pipes. Thanks to such a wide variety, one can fit the right product to the sewer system of a particular building. Before choosing a specific model, it is adviced to learn its specification to get the information on certain technical parameters.
