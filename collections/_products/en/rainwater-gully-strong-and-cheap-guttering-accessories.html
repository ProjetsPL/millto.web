  ## What is a rainwater gully?

  A rainwater gully is a kind of a connector which is responsible for two systems of a building: guttering and drainage. Thanks to its construction, it removes rainwater and hence protects the building's foundations. It eliminates groundwater from rainfalls, which might affect the structure of the building.

  Rainwater gullies affect also another element - the drainpipe. Thanks to them, one has an easy access to its bottom part. The element acts as an inspection chamber, which allows to quickly control the guttering system. Thanks to the rainwater gully, one can easily remove any debris that flows down from the roof. It won't access the drainage system, which prevents clogging and in the long run - malfunctions.

  ## What rainwater gullies are available on the market?

  A rainwater gully can be classified by two aspects. One of them is the connection type. There are models with:

  * back outlet,
  * bottom outlet.

  ## A rainwater gully - additional equipment

  Thanks to special equipment, a rainwater gully might become even more functional. There are rainwater gullies such as:

  {:.list}

  * a rainwater gully with a trap - it allows to remove water from the guttering system, as well as from the ground surrounding the building,
  * a rainwater gully with a special mesh or strain, which protects the system against various types of debris flowing in the water.

  A rainwater gully can have two of those elements. Such products are, obviously, the best, as theyprovide the best protection.

  ## Weight load class for rainwater gullies

  The equipment used for gullies used for removing the excess water from a particular area is produced in accordance with certain norms. They concern the weight load which specific elements can take. In this regard, one can distinguish four special classes for particular products. It looks like this:

  {:.list}

  * H1,5 - a class of equipment for unused roofs,
  * K3 - maximum load in this case is 2 kN,
  * L15 - acceptable load for this class is 10 kN,
  * M125 - it gives the best possibilities - the load in this case might be even 85 kN.

  Nearly every standard-use rainwater gully available on the market has the K3 load class.

  ## What rainwater gully is the best?

  Before picking a rainwater gully, pay attention to the connection type - back or bottom. It is not, however, the only criterion. Another highly important issue is the additional equipment. Almost every rainwater gully - with back or bottom outlet - has a special strain which catches the debris flowing down the drain. It is one of the better offers, definitely worth considering.

  If you decide to purchase a particular rainwater gully, do not forget about the weight load class. Choose a durable product, however do not spend your money on industrial equipment which will not be fully used.

  ## A rainwater gully - a step by step installation guide

  A proper installation of a rainwater gully is one of the most important issues when it comes to using it. Many homeowners wonder how to install a rainwater gully. It's not a complicated problem, so one can do it by themselves - without any help from a specialist. Of course, if it is needed, you can hire an expert to do it for you.

  {:.list}

  * Preparation is a key issue, as it allows one to start the installation. At this stage a hole in the ground should be made - at the spot where the rainwater gully is going to be placed. The size of the hole should be slightly larger than the element - so that you can fit it without a problem.The upper part of the gully should match the ground level.
  * The second step involves securing the bottom of the hole. The easiest method is covering it with a layer of concrete.
  * Then one can start connecting the drain pipe. Make sure to be extra precise, so that everything is leakproof and durable.
  * When the rainwater gully is connected, it has to be locked. The best solution is using concrete once again. It should fill the remaining space around the element.
  * The last part involves connecting the rainwater gully to the drainpipe. Each product might be used for various sizes - all one needs to do is adjusting the opening to the dimensions marked on the element.

  ## Rainwater gully price

  Although a rainwater gully serves a highly important role, it is not an expensive element. The price might vary depending whether the gully has a back or bottom outlet. Sometimes the value of the element is affected by its colour, the market demand and the availability of the product.

  ## Why is a rainwater gully worth buying?

  A properly working rainwater system is an absolute basis which affects particular elements and the drainage system. Furthermore, it is important for the proper condition of a building.

  Effective water removal from the guttering system and clogging prevention guarantee a properly functioning building for years.
