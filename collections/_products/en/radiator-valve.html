  ## What is a thermostatic radiator valve?

  A radiator valve is the basic equipment used in heating systems. It regulates the heat delivery to the radiator. A modern radiator valve is supposed to let as little warmth loss as possible. It directly impacts the energy distribution of the building and contributes to the savings on heating bills.

  ### Radiator valve types available on the market

  Although each product of this type serves the same function - there are many types of radiator valves available to purchase.

  * Radiator valves with a sensor are the most popular models. In this case there is a scale on the valve. The device is controlled by the user, who adjusts the heat level as needed. Those are typical radiator valves, provided by the manufacturers for years.
  * A modern radiator uses special technologies. Thanks to this, one can, for instance, control the device remotely. This type is quite common on the market, although it's price is higher than in the classical models. It is often utilized for floor radiators without a fan.
  * The last type are radiator valves with an extended sensor. It is a perfect solution whenever the radiator is located in a difficult to access spot, e.g. in a niche. It is also ideal if the radiator has to be covered.

  ## Where can a radiator valve be used?

  Currently, a radiator valve is one of the basic elements of almost every central heating system. It can be used in houses, apartments, public buildings, as well as industrial interiors. It is simply a part of a radiator providing heat to a given area.

  ## How does a radiator valve work?

  A radiator valve operates internally. There is a flexible element inside the device, usually refered to as a plug. It is filled with liquid which expands or contracts under heat. Thanks to this quality, it can quickly react to temperature changes in a room.

  When the temperature in the room matches the one set on the scale of the head of the radiator valve - no changes occur. If the temperature grows higher, the pressure on the pin increases. It conveys the pressure onto a part called pin which influences another part causing the valve to close. In case of an opposite situation - if the room's temperature drops, the valve opens and the flow of the agent in the radiator increases. After a while the temperature gets compensated.

  ## How to properly set radiator valves?

  One can control the device using the aforementioned valve head. Each radiator valve can be set according to one's individual needs. There are, however, certain guidelines for the temperature in particular rooms.

  It is suggested that the optimal warmth level for interiors like living room, bedroom and dining room is 20°C (68F). For bathrooms, the temperature should be 3-6°C higher (so 73-78F). Lowering the temperature to 17-18°C (62-64F) for nighttime is a very healthy practice - it results in a significantly better sleep. Of course, one should take their own needs into account in this range, which the most important aspect.

  ## A radiator valve - does the price always affect the quality?

  The market offers very cheap, as well as very expensive radiator valves. Does their price always affect the quality - the more expensive the product, the better? This principle does not always apply to the home systems equipmnet. Although it is true that a very cheap radiator valve should alert you. It probably is not made of good quality materials. It might lack certain functions or have a very limited scale for the temperature control. Cheap radiator valves are typically more prone to damage and when used often, they last very short.

  It does not mean, however, that the most expensive model is a guarantee of the best functions and durability for years. You should pay attention mostly to the material the radiator valve has been made of. The scale for the temperature regulation might also be a key feature, as well as the design. Classic radiator valves are certainly cheaper than their modern, specially designed counterparts.

  ## A radiator valve - which one to choose?

  A radiator valve should fit the individual needs of a user, but also the conditions of the room. Self-adjusting radiator valves which can fit their settings to the temperature of a room are quite a popular choice. They are highly recommended for places prone to sudden changes or draughts. Another commonly chosen option is a WiFi controlled radiator valve. Its price is higher in comparison with the classic equipment. Before you invest in a certain piece of equipment - check whether the radiator valve has all the functions you require. If not - paying for a gadget you will not fully use is not worth it.

  ## A radiator valve - installation tips

  Radiator valves installation does not require a visit from a specialist. In most cases, one can do everything alone, following the manufacturer's instructions. If the radiator valve is being replaced - the old model needs to be removed. Then, the thermostat's base needs to be fixed onto the connector on the radiator. Sometimes the thermostat has to be replaced with an adapter. The last step involves fixing the radiator valve and setting it up.

  Keep in mind that depending on the radiator you own - the valve is installed in various spots.
