  ## What is a thermostatic radiator valve?

  A radiator valve is the basic equipment used in heating systems. It regulates the heat delivery to the radiator. A modern radiator valve is supposed to let as little warmth loss as possible. It directly impacts the energy distribution of the building and contributes to the savings on heating bills.

  ### Radiator valve types available on the market

  Although each product of this type serves the same function - there are many types of radiator valves available to purchase.

  * Radiator valves with a sensor are the most popular models. In this case there is a scale on the valve. The device is controlled by the user, who adjusts the heat level as needed. Those are typical radiator valves, provided by the manufacturers for years.
  * A modern radiator uses special technologies. Thanks to this, one can, for instance, control the device remotely. This type is quite common on the market, although it's price is higher than in the classical models. It is often utilized for floor radiators without a fan.
  * The last type are radiator valves with an extended sensor. It is a perfect solution whenever the radiator is located in a difficult to access spot, e.g. in a niche. It is also ideal if the radiator has to be covered.

  ## Where can a radiator valve be used?

  Currently, a radiator valve is one of the basic elements of almost every central heating system. It can be used in houses, apartments, public buildings, as well as industrial interiors. It is simply a part of a radiator providing heat to a given area.

  ## How does a radiator valve work?

  A radiator valve operates internally. There is a flexible element inside the device, usually refered to as a plug. It is filled with liquid which expands or contracts under heat. Thanks to this quality, it can quickly react to temperature changes in a room.

  When the temperature in the room matches the one set on the scale of the head of the radiator valve - no changes occur. If the temperature grows higher, the pressure on the pin increases. It conveys the pressure onto a part called pin which influences another part causing the valve to close. In case of an opposite situation - if the room's temperature drops, the valve opens and the flow of the agent in the radiator increases. After a while the temperature gets compensated.

  ## How to properly set radiator valves?

  One can control the device using the aforementioned valve head. Each radiator valve can be set according to one's individual needs. There are, however, certain guidelines for the temperature in particular rooms.

  It is suggested that the optimal warmth level for interiors like living room, bedroom and dining room is 20°C (68F). For bathrooms, the temperature should be 3-6°C higher (. Lowering the temperature to 17-18°C (62-
