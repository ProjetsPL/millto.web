  ## Where did the idea for a tile leveling system come from?

  Laying tiles is a process that requires great precision. The commonly used solutions such as cross spacers usually provided good results but their usage is quite problematic. While specialists typically have no problem with this method, leveling the surface is quite a challenge if one has no experience with it. There was a need for a better solution, one that would make laying tiles easy not only for experts but also for ordinary people who wish to perform some tasks by themselves. That's how tile leveling system was made. It is an absolute game-changer and a huge convenience for every tiler.

  ## What is a tile leveling system?

  The Millto tile leveling system consists of two basic types of elements. They are tile clips and wedges, Specially shaped tile clips, or spacers are placed between two tiles – underneath. It is done at the stage of sticking the tiles to the surface. The next step involves inserting the wedges, to press two tiles to the floor and level the surface.

  The wedges have special carvings that hold the elements in the tile spacers and prevent them from moving. This way the tile leveling system is far more effective than other, traditional methods. It is also much easier to employ. For this reason the tile leveling system is used not only by professionals, but also by amateurs who want to renovate their homes by themselves.

  ## What does the tile leveling system do?

  Firstly, tile leveling system had been used only for preparing floor surfaces. Later it was noted that it's a universal solution and in fact it can be applied everywhere. For some time, tile leveling system is used also for stairs and walls. It is suitable for various types of material. It is perfect for ceramic tiles, as well as those made of granite, grès and natural stone.

  ## Tile spacers and wedges – the basic elements of the tile leveling system

  Specially shaped tile clips and wedges do not only level the tiles. Another very important aspect is the possibility to set a particular length between them. Thanks to this feature you can be sure that when grouting, the lines are going to be equally thick. It's an important factor contributing to the aesthetics of the created surface, which for many is the most crucial aspect.

  Tile wedges guarantee that the tiles will not move and change their position which is a common issue when using standard cross spacers. The tile leveling system can completely eliminate any possible mistakes made while tiling a room.

  Tile spacers, due to their characteristic construction, can be used with tiles of various thickness. Thanks to this you do not have to give up elements of thin or thick structure.

  ## Tile leveling – additional equipment

  Tile spacers and wedges are the basic elements that will help you lay the tiles quickly. There are also other, additional elements in the tile leveling system. Pliers are the most important ones. They allow to tighten the wedges precisely without the risk of damaging the tiles. Another helpful element is a small rubber mallet. You can use it to easily remove the upper part of a spacer sticking above the tile.

  ## What are the advantages of the Millto tile leveling system?

  The biggest advantage that makes the tile leveling system distinct, is its universatility. As stressed by experts, it's a perfect solution for every type of tiles: floor, wall and outdoors. Additionally, the tile can be ceramic, grès or even rectified. The tile leveling system allows you to correctly lay the elements that have various size and thickness. If you finish several rooms, you can use the same product every time.

  The tile leveling system definitely improves work efficiency. Thanks to it you can finish your house or apartment way faster. Whant's more, you don't need to hire professionals to lay the tiles. With tile levelers, anyone can do it – not worrying about any errors.

  A big plus of the tile leveling system is no need to use any additional elements. You do not have to use the level tool which might be quite problematic.

  ## How to use the tile leveling system – a step by step guide

  Laying tiles using a product like the tile leveling system is a very easy task. Nevertheless, one needs to follow a certain pattern. This way you can be sure that everything is going to go well.

  * First of all, prepare all elements that you are going to need during the installation. Apart from glue and tiles you should also remember about tile spacers and wedges that should be easily accessible.
  * Follow the instruction printed on the glue packaging and put it onto the surface and tile. Lay the tiles one by one. After setting each tile in place, use the spacers. It's very easy – just slide it into the layer of glue between floor and tile. Then lay another tile on the other side.
  * At this stage you can control the tile level using a rubber mallet. Be careful not to hit the tiles too hard, which could cause damage. If the clips are already set in place, put the wedges in. This way you can avoid unevenness. Don't be anxious to pull the wedge if it's needed. The pressure is going to be cushioned so the tiles are completely safe.
  * If the glue has dried (find the information on the required time on the packaging), it's time to remove the wedges. You can do it using either the aforementioned rubber mallet or your own leg. Remove all the protruding elements, in the direction opposite from the grouting line. As you had started the leveling process, you might have noticed that the tile clips are more fragile at the base of the part that should be placed under the tile (it's easy to bend). This feature makes it easier to remove the upper part of the spacer.

  ## Tile leveling system – what to keep in mind when choosing the right one?

  When you pick a tile leveling system, pay attention to its quality. Although both spacers and wedges can be used only once, they should be characterized by certain parameters. The carving of the wedges is definitely important. It allows you to more comfortable, but also more careful pressing of the tile to the surface.

  You should also look at the price-quality value of the elements of the tile leveling system. It's common that the product contains pliers and doesn't cost much more. It's an additional element which will help you to tighten the wedges correctly – this option is definitely worth considering.
