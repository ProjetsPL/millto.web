  ## Where did the idea for a tile leveling system come from?

  Laying tiles is a process that requires great precision. The commonly used solutions such as cross spacers usually provided good results but their usage is quite problematic. While specialists typically have no problem with this method, leveling the surface is quite a challenge if one has no experience with it. There was a need for a better solution, one that would make laying tiles easy not only for experts but also for ordinary people who wish to perform some tasks by themselves. That's how tile leveling system was made. It is an absolute game-changer and a huge convenience for every tiler.

  ## What is a tile leveling system?

  The Millto tile leveling system consists of two basic types of elements. They are tile clips and wedges, Specially shaped tile clips, or spacers are placed between two tiles – underneath. It is done at the stage of sticking the tiles to the surface. The next step involves inserting the wedges, to press two tiles to the floor and level the surface.

  The wedges have special carvings that hold the elements in the tile spacers and prevent them from moving. This way the tile leveling system is far more effective than other, traditional methods. It is also much easier to employ. For this reason the tile leveling system is used not only by professionals, but also by amateurs who want to renovate their homes by themselves.
