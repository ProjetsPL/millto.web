  ## Roof vent cap - what is it and where can it be used?

  A roof vent cap is the upper part of a construction called drain-waste vent. It's the ending piece of a plumbing vent. For a roof vent cap to work properly, it needs to be installed above the rooftop of a building. There are certain requirements that a plumbing vent should meet - for instance for its size. The size of a roof vent should be equal to the plumbing vent opening diameter. The roof vent cap should be larger, so that it can fit the vent pipe.

  ## How does a roof vent cap protect a building?

  A roof of a building is a strategic spot, prone to various types of dangers. It is mostly vulnerable to weather conditions due to seasonal weather changes. Those are, for instance, heavy rainfalls, snowfalls and windstorms. If there was no roof vent and roof vent cap, the sewage system and the plumbing vent would be exposed to those factors. Furthermore, the wind carries various objects - leaves, branches and other elements. If the plumbing vent was not protected, it could get clogged - which in the long run requires costly repairs. A roof vent cap protects the system from any unwanted elements.

  Birds and rodents are also a common problem. A roof vent cap is perfect for such situations, as it protects the system of a building from unexpected pests.

  A roof vent cap mostly protects home interiors. It stops unpleasant smells from sewer tracts and improves the sewer drainage.

  ## Sewer system ventilation - what is it?

  The processes in the sewer systems are the cause of unpleasant smelling gases. A roof vent prevents them from spreading to the rooms in the building. It also serves another function. A roof vent also allows the air to enter the plumbing system, thanks to which the waste is removed more efficiently.

  ## An roof vent cap - where should it be installed?

  There are certain guidelines stating how a roof vent cap should look like. They concern both the location of the roof vent, as well as its size. The height is the most important issue in this matter. It should regard the aforementioned snowfalls. It should be tall enough, so that the roof vent cap lies above the layer of snow, allowing the airflow.

  Roof vent caps cannot be located by an air intake vent or a vent outlet on the roof. What is more, it cannot be installed by windows and doors either. The general guidelines clearly state the minimal distance that should be kept from those spots - 4 meters.

   Plumbing vent must not be connected with chimney or air vents of a building.

  ## Why is a roof vent better than an air admittance valve?

  Roof vents are considered a far better choice than air admittance valves. Although the latter seems a simpler solution as they can be installed inside a building instead of its roof, they have some serious disadvantages.

  A well constructed plumbing ventilation is based mostly on a two-way air exchange - removal of gases and pumping fresh air into the system so that the waste is removed efficiently. The air admittance valves can bleed the system, but they cannot resupply the fresh air to the system. For this reason a roof vent is a far better solution.
