  ## How often is a radiant heat manifold used?

  A radiant heat manifold is one of the most basic elements in a heating system of every building. It can be used both in a house and in an apartment. It's role is spreading the heat evenly, so the conduits of the heating system work efficiently and provide the proper thermal comfort.

  ### Heat manifold - where can it be used?

  A radiant heat manifold is a very universal solution, which can be used both in traditional systems - those using classic radiators, and in modern underfloor heating systems. For each of those systems, a manifold allows for easy temperature control, depending on the needs of its users.
