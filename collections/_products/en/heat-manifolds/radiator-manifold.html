  ## How often is a radiant heat manifold used?

  A radiant heat manifold is one of the most basic elements in a heating system of every building. It can be used both in a house and in an apartment. It's role is spreading the heat evenly, so the conduits of the heating system work efficiently and provide the proper thermal comfort.

  ### Heat manifold - where can it be used?

  A radiant heat manifold is a very universal solution, which can be used both in traditional systems - those using classic radiators, and in modern underfloor heating systems. For each of those systems, a manifold allows for easy temperature control, depending on the needs of its users.

  ## Radiant heat manifolds - construction

  The construction of a radiant heat manifold is very similar to other models of equipment of this type. The difference lies in small, yet important details, which makes this manifold unique. Complete sets offered by manufacturers contain all needed elements, allowing the users to assemble and run the device.

  The set contains installation holders and bars, which are the basis of the whole device. The bars have been equipped with nipples to install circuits and red and blue control valves.

  ### Holders and bars - the base of every manifold

  Regardless of the manufacturer, all holders sold with manifolds are made of stainless steel. It prevents vibrations which could disrupt the device's operation, and, as a result affect its efficiency. Thanks to those elements there's no concern about the fixing of the equipment. It's reliable - and durable for a very long time.

  Another, probably the most important elements are bars. They contain brass nipples that should be attached to specific circuits. The upper bar also has control valves attached, which regulate the flow of the warm liquid. The lower bar contains valves that control cold water. They can be easily distinguished by their colour.

  ### Brass nipples - how to quickly attach a radiant heat manifold?

  There are brass nipples on the manifold bars. They serve the most important role for the whole device. Without them, the heat manifold would be useless. Nipples allow for attaching heating circuits to the device - thanks to which a manifold can easily control the tempeerature in each of them.

  ### Control valves - how to easily set up a manifold?

  Control valves allow for a quick regulation of the manifold device. Manual control is very easy, therefore most of the users should be able to do it. Each valve has a 5-grade scale on it. Thankss to this, one can control manifold at any time. Increasing or decreasing the warmth level in a room will never be a problem anymore. Just turn the valve that controls a particular circuit.

  ## How to choose the right radiant heat manifold?

  When choosing a manifold, you should pay attention to the number of circuits in your heating system. There are manifold models that allow to control from 2 to 12 circuits. For this reasoon, one should match the device with individual needs of a user.

  If you are not sure how many circuits your manifold should have - consult this issue with an expert responsible for the heating system of the building. Too many, as well as too little of circuits of a radiant heat manifold can complicate the whole system's operation, makes it prone to malfunctions and inefficient.

  ### How much does a radiant heat manifold cost?

  The price of equipment like a manifold depends on the number of circuits that can be attached to it. The cheapest manifolds are the models that can operate 2 circuits. The cost of the device rises with every additional circuit. It also results from the construction of a manifold, which reqquires using a larger number of equipment.
