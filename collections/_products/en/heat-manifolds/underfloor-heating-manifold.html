  ## What is a radiant heat manifold?

  Manifolds are the basic products used in heating systems - mostly for underfloor heating. The main purpose of this element is to connect, cut off and regulate sevaral heating circuits. Thanks to this one can get various parameters for each of them. In addition, manifolds can be also connected to a mixing valve.

  ### Why should you invest in a underfloor heating manifold?

  Under floor heating conduits - that is, water pipes - are placed under the floor. The often from a looped section. The implementation of a manifold in such case is crucial. Thanks to it, the heat spreads evenly in each room that has been connected with the system. Moreover, underfloor heating manifold can be controlled by the user, who can choose the right temperature fit to their individual expectations.

  ### Underfloor heating manifold - how is it constructed?

  Surprisingly, the underfloor heating manifold is not very complicated. Each of its elements meets particular requirements and serves a specific purpose. The basic part of each device are brackets. They allow to install the manifold in a cabinet.

  Other elements that form a radiant heating manifold are two bars. The lower one is called the return, and the upper the supplying bar. Depending on the model - an underfloor heating manifold can contain from 2 to 12 circuits.

  Nipples placed on both of the bars allow to quickly connect the circuits to the manifold. It's also very easy. The lower bar is equipped with additional regulating valves - also called thermostatic. You can use them to manually regulate the temperature in a room.

  The upper bar contains flow meters. The rotameters allows to control the flow of the water. The value of this parameter is determined by a float in the control pipe. There is a clear scale on its wall, which shows the intensity of the flow.

  ## Air vent in an underfloor manifold - is it important?

  Many manifold models have an air vent installed on the bars. It's a very important element - it removes the air from the system. The excess of gas in a heating system might cause noise in the pipes, and in the long run it might disrupt the heating process.

  ## Is it difficult to install a manifold?

  The radiant heat manifold is available with all elements needed for its installation. The most important part involves attaching the holders to the manifold's bars. The frame eliminates vibrations which could disrupt the manifold's work. Another important aspect is placing the bars as the manufacturer suggests. The supply bar should be in the upper part, and the return bar - at the bottom. It's not difficult to do and nobody should have any problem with it.

  Attaching the pipes to the manifold is not very complicated, either. It's easy thanks to the aforementioned nipples - they significantly reduce the time of installation.

  ## How to choose the right underfloor heating manifold?

  When choosing equipment such as a manifold for underfloor heating, pay close attention to the number of circuits that can be attached to the bars. It's a parameter that is strictly connected to the construction of the installation and the size of the unit that is going to be heated by underfloor heating. Very large buildings typically use several manifolds.

  ### Price of a manifold - what does the price depend on?

  The price of a manifold is a value that grows proportionally to the number of circuits that are going to be attached to it. The simplest models for just two circuits are definitely cheaper than 12-circuits manifolds. It is best to choose a manifold made of high quality materials from a good manufacturer.
