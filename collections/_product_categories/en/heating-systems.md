title: Heating systems
description: Thermal comfort is one of the most important aspects in every building. A heating system must function properly, no matter whether it’s a residential, office, or industrial building. Depending on the character of the property, however, the systems are quite different. A heating system that is perfect for a private house might be insufficient for an industrial building – and vice versa. For this reason it is crucial to choose the right solution.
